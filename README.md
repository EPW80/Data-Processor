# Data Processing Project

This project aims to develop a comprehensive data processing application designed specifically for analyzing Python code. The application reads data from an input file, meticulously processes the data to remove any excess spaces and comments, tokenizes the remaining code, and finally, presents the output in a clear, tabular format.

## Objective

The primary goal of this Python-based application is to:

1. **Read data from an input file:** Read the code from an input file.
2. **Remove excess spaces and comments:** Clean up the code by removing unnecessary whitespace and comments.
3. **Tokenize the cleaned code:** Analyze and categorize the code into tokens such as keywords, identifiers, operators, delimiters, and literals.
4. **Output the cleaned code:** Display the processed code, free from comments and excess spacing.
5. **Output the tokenized code:** Display the processed code in a tabular format, making it easier to read and understand.

## Installation & Usage

To use this application, follow these simple steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   git clone git@github.com:CSUF-CPSC-323-Spring24/data-processing-project-group-4.git

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   cd Data-Processing-Project

3. **Run the Application:**
   python3 code_processor.py

- Make sure you have a Python interpreter installed and an `input.txt` file in the project directory containing the Python code you wish to analyze.\*

## Features

- **Code Cleaning:** Removes excess space and comments from the code.
- **Tokenization:** Categorizes the code into tokens, such as keywords, identifiers, operators, delimiters, and literals.
- **Tabularized Output:** Presents results in a formatted tabular output, making it easier to read and understand.
